/*
- Print every letter of the word "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" to the console, one at a time.

- Next, do the same, except only print the letter if it's an 'i'. If it's any other letter, print "Not an i".

Bonus: After that, print the number of letters in the word (do this with code, not by counting manually and hard-coding the number).

Another Bonus: In part 2, also determine if the letter is 'L'. If it is, print 'L'.
